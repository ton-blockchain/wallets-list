### **Why We Audit Integrations**

* Ensure the **best possible experience** for TON ecosystem users.  
* Confirm that TON Connect is implemented securely, reliably, and in alignment with our specifications.

   * Ensure all functionalities (e.g., connection, transaction signing, error handling) work as expected.  
3. **Review Wallet Manifest Requirements**:  
   * Familiarize yourself with the [**wallet manifest format and requirements**](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallets-list/?tab=readme-ov-file#entry-format).  
   * Ensure your wallet manifest follows the specified format with all required fields.  
4. **Submit a PR**:  
   * Open a Pull Request (PR) to add your wallet to the TON Connect registry.

### **Audit Process Details**

* **Initial Review**:  
  * Our team will schedule an audit and share a report.  
  * If no issues are found, your PR will be merged promptly.  
* **Revisions & Re-Audits**:  
  * If issues arise, weâ€™ll provide feedback. Once fixes are implemented, weâ€™ll re-audit.  
  * This cycle continues until all requirements are met.

### **Audit Timeline**

* **Typical Duration**: \~3 working days (*after the audit begins*).  
* **Current Backlog**: Due to high demand (15+ wallets in the queue), audits may be delayed.  
  * We appreciate your patience and will notify you once your audit is scheduled.
